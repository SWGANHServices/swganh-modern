## üéØ Project Goals

- **Beginner-Friendly**: Easy setup and contribution process
- **Modern Architecture**: C++ core with Lua scripting layer
- **SWG 14.1 Compatible**: Full Pre-CU experience
- **Modular Design**: Plugin-based extensibility
- **Production Ready**: Docker deployment and monitoring

## üèóÔ∏è Project Relationship

This project is part of the [SWGANHServices](https://github.com/SWGANHServices) organization's effort to modernize Star Wars Galaxies emulation:

- **swganh-modern** (this project) - Modern C++/Lua server core
